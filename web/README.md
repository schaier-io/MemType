You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org) as a framework. To maintain privacy and enable runtime efficiency (low cost hosting), the app is built as a static site, which can be hosted on any of your favorite hosting services.
