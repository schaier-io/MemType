These components can be found in the [web/src/components](../web/src/components) directory.

## Theme

- **Colors**: Uses system theme (dark/light) with accent colors
- **Typography**: Geist Sans and Geist Mono fonts as default
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale
- **Animations**: Subtle transitions for interactive elements
- **Gamification**: Make it fun to play, while still challenging the student
